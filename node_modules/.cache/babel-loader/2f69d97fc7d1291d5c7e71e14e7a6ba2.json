Jack asked, &ldquo;What will you give me in return for my cow?&rdquo; The man answered, &ldquo;I will give you five magic beans!&rdquo; Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he reached home, Jack&rsquo;s mother was very angry. She said, &ldquo;You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!&rdquo; She threw the beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.</p>\n<p>The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went inside the house and found the giant&rsquo;s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, &ldquo;Could you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!&rdquo; The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.</p>\n<p>While he was eating, the giant came home.

He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went to sleep.
